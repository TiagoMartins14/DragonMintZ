## Overview

DragonMintZ is a Web3 application that lets users mint NFT representations of legendary DBZ characters and the iconic 7 Dragon Balls using a random minting mechanism powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The project utilizes:
- **Foundry** for contract development
- **ERC1155** for flexible token standard
- **IPFS (via Pinata)** to host character metadata and images

## Token Breakdown

- 🎴 **15 Characters** – Each minted randomly.
- 🟠 **7 Dragon Balls** – Collectible, and key to unlocking Shenron.
- 🐉 **Shenron** – A special NFT that becomes available only when the user holds **all 7 Dragon Balls**.

> Shenron can only be minted once **per wallet** and only the **after** all Dragon Balls are collected.

## 🎲 Randomness Mechanism

The character or item minted is determined by a pseudo-random algorithm:

1. Concatenates the caller’s address, the current timestamp, and previous block hash.
2. Applies a keccak256 hash to the data.
3. Reduces the result using modulus to fit the available token ID range.

> ⚠️ This randomness is **not cryptographically secure**. It’s sufficient for fun minting, but susceptible to manipulation in high-stakes settings. For real randomness, services like Chainlink VRF are recommended.

## Contracts & Deployment

The smart contracts follow the **ERC1155** standard for multi-token minting (Shenron logic is implemented via internal state checks during minting).

> Contract deployed to Sepolia Testnet [Address](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7229199956087715Bd5E355Ab4783b60dd11f651)
> 
> Metadata and token art stored on IPFS via [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the app locally:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

make
```

Once done, open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:3000 to access the app.

## Tips & Testing

### Interacting with the Docker Container

You can interact with the container on a separate terminal window via:

```bash
docker exec -it dragonmintz bash
```

### Running Smart Contract Tests

Navigate to the contract directory and run Foundry tests:docker exec -it dragonmintz 
```
cd Contract
forge test
```
